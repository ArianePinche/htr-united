  The Paris Bible Project aims to understand the production and diffusion of
  medieval Latin Bibles in Europe. The dataset includes ground truth from Paris
  Bibles produced in the 13th and 14th centuries. We also provide the most
  recent version of our list of Paris Bible manuscripts found in the world along
  with information about them.
