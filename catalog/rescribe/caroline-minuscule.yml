transcription-guidelines: "In general this meant deciding between diplomatic transcription\
  \ (i.e. sticking to what it says on the page) and gently modernized features (i.e.\
  \ reinterpreting medieval signs into modern equivalents) with a view to specific\
  \ categories. Read on for a summary of the rules and the respective rationale behind\
  \ them.\nSUMMARY\nPUNCTUATION\n\n    Modern: medieval punctuation is transcribed\
  \ with modern equivalents; punctus elevatus transcribed as semicolon\n\nCAPITALIZATION\n\
  \n    Diplomatic: Original capitalization retained\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\n    Diplomatic\
  \ where possible: Retain abbreviations and render glyphs as opposed to expanded\
  \ versions where possible\n    \"*\" where original character isn't served: OCRopus\
  \ (at the point in time of transcription) could not handle some of the medieval\
  \ glyphs, even where a Unicode version was present. Abbreviations not in OCRopus\
  \ are uniformly transcribed as \"*\", in the case of a combined character (such\
  \ as a consonant with a macron) as the base character followed by \"*\" (e.g. \"\
  t*\"). The list of accepted characters in OCRopus can be found in this repository,\
  \ and downloaded and used as codec in the OCRopus training process.\n\nSPACING\n\
  \n    Diplomatic: Preserve manuscript spacing, i.e. give diplomatic transcription\n\
  \nNUMBERS\n\n    Diplomatic: retain original version of both Roman and Arabic numerals'\n"
