  The Dataset is made up of 300 images, with their related ground truth stored in a XML file (pageXML format). Images come from three manuscripts selected among the collections of the BULAC Library (Paris). It covers a representative part of the handwritten production in Arabic Maghrebi scripts and includes an annotation of the layout (TextRegions, baselines and polygons) and the transcription of the main text. This dataset is the result of a collaborative transcription. All the participants are credited on the official deposit. With the support of the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, the Research Consortium Middle-East and Muslim Worlds (GIS MOMM), Calfa and the BULAC library.
